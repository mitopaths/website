            MitopatHs is a database that allows <em><strong>to navigate among the <strong>biochemical pathways (PatHs) of human (H)  mitochondria (Mito)</strong>. </strong></em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The tool core is Zsyntax, a logical system that precisely and rigorously represents biochemical processes of any lenght as deductive processes. In this formal representation, biochemical transitions from an initial molecular aggregate to a final molecular aggregate are considered as logical theorems leading form an initial premise to a conclusion.

                    On that basis, mitochondrial pathways collected in MitopatHs are presented in two ways:

                    1) <strong>as a <em>"biological theorem"</em></strong>, whose proof can be scrutinized by observing the list of biological steps involved in the pathwhay, orgnaized and encoded as logical deductions;

            </div>

                <p>
                    2) <strong>as a (dynamically growing) graph</strong>, that allows to intuitively visualize the process of building final molecular compounds from initial molecular aggregates. There are two kind of visualizations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dynamic View</strong> (a time visualization). It represents the successive biochemical steps from the initial molecular aggregate to the final molecular aggregate;</li>
                  <li><strong>Dynamic Mito_Location</strong> (a space visualization). It presents the same successive biochemical steps by considering the locations of the involved molecules in the mitochondrial compartments (outer membrane, matrix, inter-membrane space, inner membrane)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>


            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>
                    In addition, given a mitochondrial pathway, MithopatHs provides information on the existing <strong>deregulated variants</strong> and on the proteins (and the genes) involved by a link to their corresponding entry on  the Gene Ontology database.
